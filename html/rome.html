					<h1>The Colosseum</h1>
					<p>The Colosseum is the most recognizable and iconic monument of Rome, if you see no other site in Rome you should see this structure. This grand stadium was constructed by the Flavian emperors. In 508-544BC the valley where the colosseum now stands had been drained. Houses and public buildings were constructed at this point where four regions of ancient Rome converged. The Great Fire of Rome in 64AD cleared the area and Nero had a new palace complex, Domus Aurea, constructed on the grounds. Under Vespasian much of Nero's private property was returned to the people and the construction of a grand amphitheatre began (71-72AD) on part of the property. The amphitheatre was completed during the reign of Titus in 80AD and by 81AD a third level had been added. At this time hypogeum, a series of spaces beneath the arena used as a "backstage" area were excavated. In the 2nd century repairs were carried out and in 222 after extensive fire damage the colosseum was completely rebuilt over the course of 30 years.
					</p>
					<p>The colosseum was used for bull fights, gladiator fights, chariot races, official events and various public forms of entertainment. At its peek the most popular event was the Ludi Circenses, the chariot races, there were also naval battles reproduced with complex stage effects. The colosseum also hosted staged hunts, using live animals and often involved feeding convicts to the beasts. Mythological dramas were staged in the arena among scenic woods complete with forest animals. Rome had a strict class system and there were 5 levels of seating within the audience according to your social status. At capacity the arena could hold 50,000 to 80,000 spectators on the marble benches.
					</p>
					<p>In 404 the colosseum saw its last gladiator fight when the Christian Orthodox Emperor Theodosius banned all forms of paganism and customs. The colosseum fell into disrepair firstly from the Visigoths sacking of Rome and then in the 400s pieces of the architecture were stolen for reuse in new structures. More repairs followed as did earthquakes, vandalism and the sacking of Rome by the Vandals of Genseric.
					</p>
					<p>From the 6th to 13th century, as the property of the Church of Santa Maria Nova the colosseum became a thruway and residential area. Ownership of the property changed over the years and looting continued as stone by stone the colosseum was dismantled. Finally in 1750 true restoration began under Pope Benedict XIV.
					</p>
					<p>Today the amphitheatre is still the largest in the world and is the model on which the amphitheatres are based. There is now a museum in the upper floor of the outer wall and the arena is used for Roman Catholic ceremonies several times a year. The colosseum was recently chosen as one of the New Seven Wonders of the World.

					<h1>The Pantheon</h1>
					<p class = "displayFlex">The Pantheon in Rome was built on the orders of Hadrian between 118AD and 125AD, it functioned as a temple to all the Roman Gods. The temple was built to replace Marcus Agrippa's temple which had burnt down in 80AD. The original inscription can still be seen above the Pantheon entrance "Marcus Agrippa son of Lucius, having been consul three times made it." The building is in such good condition thanks to renovations made by the Byzantine Emperor Phocas in 608AD when it was converted into a church. The church became the final resting place for several Italian kings including King Vittorio Emanuele II, Umberto I and the artist Raphael who was buried here together with his fiancée. The Pantheon architecture was unlike other Roman Temples and so historians wonder at the buildings use.
					</p>
					<p>The Pantheon façade features a triangular pediment which once would have held sculptured battle scenes. The pediment is supported by three rows of columns leading into the front portico. From the rectangular front entrance hall (cella) bronze doors lead in to the main part of the building which is circular. The marble veneer covering the interior walls was a later addition but the geometric patterned marble floor is the original Ancient Roman floor.
					</p>
					<p>Within the building intersecting arches rest on piers which support 8 round headed arches. On floor level there are 8 corresponding bays which house statues. The star feature of the Pantheon is the dome, supported by a series of arches brilliantly engineered to hold the heavy dome. To further help support the weight of the dome the walls beneath the dome gradually decrease in thickness. Also the builders used lightweight materials on the upper part of the structure and heavier, sturdy materials on the lower section. One of the fascinating qualities of the Pantheon architecture is the proportions of the dome which, if flipped upside down would fit exactly into the Rotunda. At the highest central point of the dome is an oculus, a circular opening, which floods the space with natural light. The oculus is lined with bronze and was never closed.
					</p>
					<p>This meant that rain entered the building and drained off of the slightly convex floor into discrete drainpipes. The interior height and the diameter of the dome are identical at 43.3 meters. Unfortunately we don't know the name of the architect responsible for all of this precise and ingenious architecture. The symmetry and mathematical skill used to create the Pantheon has been admired by artists and architects for centuries and remains an inspiration to artists and designers.

					<h1>Piazza Navona</h1>
					<p>Piazza Navona is an elongated oval-shaped public square in Rome, it was built on the former Stadium of Domitian (the remains of which can still be seen on guided tours from Piazza Tor Sanguigna13). The original name was Circus Agonalis or Circus Agonalis. The Piazza was paved in the 15th century and used as a market place and a venue for special events including mock naval battles. Today is a lively and popular social meeting point in the numerous cafes, restaurants and places of entertainment which line the square. The square is the venue for many annual fairs and festivals.  The Church of Sant'Agnese in Agone (1670)is also on the square and is perhaps the sources of the square's present name.
					</p>
					<p>The main attractions of the square are the three fountains, the most famous being Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi. The Fountain of the Four Rivers was completed in 1651 and although originally the artist Borromini was commissioned, ultimately Bernini took over the design. The fountain features an obelisk brought from the Massenzio Circus and surrounding the fountain base are figures representing four great rivers: The Nile, Ganges, Danube and Rio de la Plata.
					</p>
					<p>The Neptune Fountain (Fontana del Nettuno) or Calderari was designed by Giacomo della Porta and constructed in 1576. Further statues of Neptune and the sea nymphs were added in the 19th century.
					</p>
					<p>The Fontana del Moro was also created by della Porta. The central statue was designed by Bernini in the 17th century and features a Moor  and a dolphin. The Tritons (male mermaids) were added in the 19th century.

					<h1>St. Peter's Square</h1>
					<p>The expansive St. Peter's Square is located within Vatican City in front of St. Peter's Basilica. In the 1600s the plaza was designed by Bernini who also had a hand in designing the adjacent basilica. His design was limited by the constraints of surrounding structures but he managed to create a trapezoid shaped plaza of grand proportions.
					</p>
					<p>The elliptical shaped open area of the square is surrounded by 284 Tuscan-style Doric colonnades, in 4 rows; the columns are 13 meters high. The enormous scale of the square and its surrounding columns was intended to create awe in the worshipers who gather here to receive the Pope's blessing from the church or Vatican Palace where he often appears to address the crowds. The square is paved in cobbled stones divided up only by radiating lines created from limestone and zodiac signs so that the obelisks can be used as a giant sun dial. A red porphyry stone on the paving marks where Pope John Paul II was shot in 1981.
					</p>
					<p>An ancient Egyptian obelisk stands at the plaza center, Bernini's granite fountain and a fountain designed by Carlo Maderno flank the obelisk in the papal courtyard. Visitors enter the square through the Ponte Sant'Angelo along the via della Conciliazione. St. Peter's Square is a masterpiece in architecture and balance which inspires a feeling of reverence and spiritual peace.

					<h1>St. Peter's Basilica</h1>
					<p>St Peter's Basilica is perhaps the holiest and most important church in Christendom, located within Vatican City on Vatican Hill; it is the heart of the Catholic Church. The location has long been considered holy as the apostle Saint Peter is believed to have been buried here in 64AD. Peter is considered to have been the first Pope and so its place in Vatican City is fitting.  A place of worship was first established on this site in c.320AD, in the 15th century, the structure was enlarged and improved with the help of Leon Battista Alberti and Bernardo Rossellino. A new structure was created here under Bramante in 1506, and was continued by Rafael who took over the task. Rafael was followed by Baldassarre Peruzzi and later Michelangelo. Maderno was responsible for the stunning façade and finally the Basilica was consecrated in 1626. Bernini worked on the church for 20 years and was responsible for much of the beautiful interior furnishing in the 1600s.
					</p>
					<p>The basilica Latin Cross floor plan has a 186 meter long Nave with 4 aisles and the ceiling is 46 meters high. There is a 136 meter high dome (thanks to Michelangelo) which is 42 meters in diameter. Visitors can climb the 491 steps to get breathtaking views from the top. The basilica's façade is 114 meters wide and 47 meters high with a triple arched portico leading into the atrium which has a central fountain. In total the Basilica covers 22,000m² and can accommodate 20,000 worshipers. Visitors to the holy Basilica approach the building through the enormous St. Peters Square created by Bernini. St. Peter's is a major Catholic pilgrimage site and Christians arriving here begin their visit by kissing the big toe of Arnolfo da Cambio's brass statue of St. Peter on the right side of the main altar.
					</p>
					<p>Within the church there are the angelic faces of 40 types of cherubs created in stone, mosaic and metal. The statues of 39 saints, the founders of religious congregations, appear along the sides of the Nave and across the Transept.
					</p>
					<p>In all there are 45 altars, 11 chapels and 10,000m² of mosaics as well as beautiful marble floors. Among the valuable pieces of Renaissance and Baroque art in the Basilica is Michelangelo's Pieta in the first chapel on the right. Other stunning works of art in St. Peters are the bronze baldachin above the papal altar and the confession (burial crypt) of St. Peter. St. Peter's tomb is one of 100 tombs within the church; they include 91 popes, kings and queens.

					<h1>Piazza Venezia</h1>
					<p>Capitoline Hill next to Trajan's Forum. Piazza Venezia is not a pedestrian square and the large square sees endless traffic, including most buses. The square is close to many tourist sites and most visitors will find themselves crossing this square at some point in their trip to Rome.
					</p>
					<p>Several important buildings line the square including the Palazzo Venezia, commissioned by the Cardinal Venezia. The square takes its name from the palace. The palace was completed in 1464 and belonged to Pope Paul II, it continued to be the residence of successive popes until Pope Pius IV. After that it became the Venice Embassy (Serenissima) and later was acquired by Mussolini's government. The dictator would give speeches from the palace balcony. Today it houses the Museo del Palazzo Venezia.
					</p>
					<p>Other buildings on the square are the Assicurazioni Generali building (1911); the Monument of victor Emanuel II (Il Vittoriano); Palazzo Bonaparte, the former home of Napoleon Bonaparte's mother; Palazzo delle Aste and San Marco Church (1336). During digging to construct part of the Rome metro line in 2009 the ancient remains of Hadrian's Athenaeum were discovered directly beneath the middle of Piazza Venezia.

					<h1>The Sistine Chapel</h1>
					<p>The Sistine Chapel is part of the Vatican Museums and is named after Pope Sixtus IV (pope from 1471 to 1484). He ordered the restoration of the old Cappella Magna which was carried out by an illustrious list of artists including Botticelli, Perugino and Domenico Ghirlandaio. The chapel was inaugurated in 1483 as Our Lady of the Assumption. Julius II della Rovere (pope from 1503-1513) ordered the refinement and redecoration of the chapel decoration and employed Michelangelo for the job.  In 1512 the work was complete and the space was inaugurated as the Sistine Chapel. Later in 1533 Michelangelo was asked by Clement VII to paint the Last Judgment on the altar wall replacing the 15th century frescoes. In the 16th century the entrance wall frescoes were painted again, this time by Hendrik van den Broeck and da Lecce. More recently in 1979 and 1999 the chapel frescoes were restored.
					</p>
					<p>Each surface of the chapel is covered with exquisite art, the Last Judgment is painted on the wall opposite the entrance; the story of Christ is featured on the North Wall and the stories of Moses on the South Wall. However the main painting which visitors come to see is the ceiling fresco by Michelangelo.
					</p>
					<p>Michelangelo was originally commissioned to paint 12 apostles and ornamental motifs however he was not too enamored with this idea and eventually was given a free hand to plan the ceiling painting as he pleased. He constructed a scaffold of his own invention and painted the masterpiece while lying on his back. He painted 9 important events from the Book of Genesis down the center of the  ceiling, the most famous being God giving Adam life with the touching of their two finger tips. Around the outer edge of the central scenes are paintings of the 12 prophets and Sibyls. In the four corners of the ceiling are scenes from the miraculous salvation of the people of Israel.
					</p>
					<p>The chapel is used for mass and other services throughout the year and there is a permanent choir, the Sistine Chapel Choir.
					</p>
					<p>But the space's most important function is as the Papal Conclave. This is where the Popes are elected in a conclave of the College of Cardinals. A chimney is erected from the chapel leading up to the roof and with the use of different colored smoke a signal is made when a new Pope has been chosen. Although the cardinals no longer camp out in the chapel while they come to a discussion, the chapel is still used as the venue for the voting for the new Pope.

					<h1>Trevi Fountain</h1>
					<p>The Fontana di Trevi is the largest baroque fountain in the world. The fountain is well known from the Fellini film "La Dolce Vita" and "Three Coins in The Fountain." Legend has it that if you throw a coin into the fountain and make a wish to return to Rome, your wish will be granted. It is situated in the Trevi District of Rome at a junction of three roads (hence the name tre-three+vie-roads). The fountain is 26,30 meters high, 49,15 meters wide, 80,000 cubic meters of water flow through the fountain every day and it is mostly carved from travertine stone.
					</p>
					<p> The fountain also marks the terminal point of one of Ancient Rome's 11 aqueducts, Aqua Virgo, which was constructed by Marcus Agrippa c.19BC during the reign of Emperor Augustus. The aqueduct covered 21km to bring fresh spring water into the city supplying clean drinking water for about 400 years. Agrippa had the aqueduct built to bring water to the Campus Martius thermal baths. The name of the aqueduct comes from a legend that tells of a virgin leading tired and thirsty soldiers to the source of water. Fountains were, and still are, a regular feature in Rome, by the 4th century there were 1352 Roman fountains. The aqueduct suffered damage in 537 when the Ostrogoths attacked Rome but in the early renaissance period the popes began restoring the aqueduct fountain.
					<p>Various popes had a hand in restoring the fountain and even relocating and reorienting it. It was Urbanus VIII who commissioned Bernini to work on the fountain. In 1730 a contest was held to design a new fountain and Nicola Salvi won. In 1743 the new fountain began flowing with water. Giuseppe Pannini (son of Giampaolo) took over the completion of the fountain decoration. Bracci also had a hand in the creation by carving the marble Ocean's Triumph according to Salvi's design. Work was completed in 1762.
					</p>
					<p>The statue of Ocean stands at the highest and central point of the fountain, he stands in a chariot pulled by two horses ridden by two Tritons.
					</p>
					<p>One Triton is old and one is young while one horse is restless and the other calm. To the left of Ocean is a statue of Abundance and to the right a statue of Health. Above the statues are reliefs of Agrippa overseeing the construction of the aqueduct and another of the Virgin leading the soldiers to the water. There are also allegorical figures and carvings of about 30 types of plants.
					</p>
					<p>The Trivi Fountain is perhaps Rome's most romantic fountain and visitors can drink from the cast iron pipes situated on the steps. Money thrown into the fountain is used to finance maintenance of the fountain.

					<h1>Roman Forum</h1>
					<p>The Roman Forum is located in a valley between Piazza Venezia and the Colosseum, between the Palatine Hill, Capitoline Hill and Esquiline Hill. The area was originally marshlands which were cleared with an ingenious system during the reign of the last Etruscan kings (until 509BC). The Cloaca Maxima canal was constructed to drain off the land into the Tiber River. Once the area was inhabitable it began to develop into an urban center and for more than 1000 years this was the most important part of the city. The area's central square, called Foro, was where the Romans would gather for meetings, trials and trade, the Forum was the center of life in Ancient Rome. Also in the Forum there were markets, temples, government buildings, stores and inns.
					</p>
					<p>Several structures remain in the Forum from different periods in history. The 70 foot high Arch of Septimius Severus, (203AD) to commemorate the victory over the Parthians. It is adorned with intricate bas-reliefs. Statues remain from the House of the Vestal Virgins (Atrium Vestae), which was a 3 story, 50 room residence which accommodated the virgin priestesses. Several of the original 20 Corinthian columns from the Temple of Vesta remain, built on a podium 15 meters in diameter. The Curia Julia was where the Senate would gather and although there were several locations over the course of Roman history, the Curia which remains was constructed under Diocletian in 283AD.
					</p>
					<p>The Rostra was a platform where speeches were made. The present platform was commissioned by Caesar and made out of marble, it measured 24 meters wide and 12 meters deep. The Column of Phocas is the most recent addition to the Forum, constructed in 608AD to commemorate a visit by the Byzantine Emperor Phocas to Rome.  Other outstanding structures in the Forum include the Temple of Saturn; Temple of Vespasian and Titus; Temple of Castor and Pollux; Temple of Antoninus and Faustina and several churches like the Basilica Julia (54BC); Basilica of Maxentius (308AD) and Basilica Aemilia (179BC).

					<h1>Palatine Hill and Palatine Museum</h1>
					<p><b>Palatine Hill</b><br>This is one of the famous seven hills on which Rome was founded and is the most centrally located. From its height of 40 meters it is surrounded by the Circus Maximus, Forum Romanum and the Colosseum. Archaeological findings show that the site was inhabited as far back as the 10th century BC. Traditionally it was the site of the Lupercal Cave where Romulus and Remus were nursed by a she-wolf and so it would have been where Romulus began building the city (754BC).
					</p>
					<p>During the Roman Republican Era the hill was a fashionable residential area due to the hill's height and spectacular views it afforded. The great leaders of the Roman Empire chose this hill as their home and the site was wall-to-wall palaces at one point. And so the word "palace" is derived from "Palatine." First Emperor Augustus made the hill his headquarters, constructing Imperial palaces there, then they were expanded under Julio-Claudian Emperors and by Nero. Finally Domitian had Rabirius design his Flavian Palace which was built on top of the existing dwellings. 
					</p>
					<p>Visitors can see the archaeological findings from the Palatine Hill on display in the Palace of the Caesars which houses the Palatine Museum. Other sites on the Palatine Hill include the excavated ruins of the House of Augustus, House of Livia, Domus Augustana and the Palace of Septimius Severus.
					</p>
					<p><b>Palatine Museum</b><br>The Museo Palatino is located on Palatine Hill within the Palace of the Caesars and houses archaeological findings from Palatine Hill. The artifacts in the museum date back to Iron Age tombs proving that Palatine Hill was probably the first settlement in Rome. There are the remains of huts dating back to the 8th century BC, the traditional date of Rome's establishment by Romulus.
					</p>
					<p>Thanks to the ongoing excavations items have been uncover which allow us to trace the progress of Rome from its beginnings, through the Republic Era and into the Roman Empire and late ancient periods. Findings on the hill show fortified walls, drainage systems, temples and palatial villas.
					</p>
					<p>Palatine Hill was the site of many palaces in Ancient Rome and the museum holds statues, mosaics and frescoes collection from excavations of the Palatine villas. In particular the artifacts on show come from the 1st – 4th century when the Palatine Hill was at its peak. You can see both art work found in the Palatine palaces and pieces of the architecture which were rescued, like parts of columns and even walls. Together with the actual statues and archaeological findings there are photos of other pieces displayed as well. On one of the floors of the museum you can see an exhibit about the prehistoric growth of Rome. One of the most significant items in the museum is painted decorations from Aula Isiaca, as well as works from other Palatine buildings like the House of Augustus, House of Livia and the House of Gryphons.

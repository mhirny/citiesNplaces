					<h1>Brandenburg Gate</h1>
					<p>The Brandenburger Tor also known as the Brandenburg Gate is one of Berlin's most visited attractions and one that once symbolized the divided city of Berlin for many years. The gate served as the main entrance to the city of Berlin when it was first built while much later, before the two parts were united, visitors would come to Brandenburg Gate to climb to its observation tower simply to see the other side of Berlin.
					</p>
					<p>On the gate you could see the famous sculpture that represents the Goddess of Victory. The sculpture was actually held in captivity in France where it served as a Napoleonic trophy. The gate’s design was inspired by the Propylaea, which was the gateway that led to the Acropolis an Athens while the decorations found on the gate depict Greek mythology.
					</p>
					<p>Directly next to the gate there  are two landmarks - the Pariser Platz and the American Embassy.
					</p>
					<p>Damaged during the Second World War, the Brandenburger Tor was restored in 1958 by East Berlin. When the Berlin Wall was taken down in 1989, the gate was  reopened. It underwent another renovation in 2001 and reopened in 2002.
					</p>
					<p>Brandenburg Gate is part of the Discover Berlin Half-Day Walking Tour. If you enjoy walking or biking this will be a wonderful experience for you.

					<h1>Reichstag</h1>
					<p>The Reichstag building, the location of the German Parliament, was first constructed in 1894. Originally, the Reichstag building consisted of four wings, two indoor courtyards and a chamber. After the fire in the building in 1933, its original hall was completely destroyed and had to be demolished, as the building’s dome. The building was restored only in 1961 to become the meeting site for the parliamentary committee.
					</p>
					<p>The building’s entrance is composed of columns that hold up a triangular garb. Visitors should climb the wide staircase in order to reach the building’s main entrance.
					</p>
					<p>The rebuilt dome at the Reichstag building is one of the most popular views for visitors and many also use the lift that can take you to the top of the building where you can see the Tiergarten from the building’s viewing terrace. Entering the building is free but you must register in advance in the website.
					</p>
					<p>Reichstag is part of the Berlin Highlights and Hidden Sites Historical Walking Tour. If you enjoy walking or biking this will be a wonderful experience for you.

					<h1>Alexanderplatz</h1>
					<p>Named to honor the Tsar of Russia, Alexander the First, much of Berlin’s urban history can be reached through this square as centuries of politics, culture and architecture are captured. Today, the Alexanderplatz is mostly a shopping area and a transit junction.
					</p>
					<p>As the squares become the center of East Berlin, it was used by the East Germany government to demonstrate the socialist architecture.
					</p>
					<p>In November of 1989, one million people gathered at the Alexanderplatz to hold a demonstration protesting the GDRE regime. This protest took place not long before the Berlin Wall fell and was the biggest demonstration to ever take place here.
					</p>
					<p>The Alexanderplatz is where visitors will find The House of Travel. Its name is ironic due to the fact that the GRD placed many travel restrictions. Visitors that go there now hold the publishing house known as Berliner Verlag. This is where the offices of Berlin’s daily newspaper, Berliner Zeitung, are now.

					<h1>Fernsehturm</h1>
					<p>Fersehtum is Berlin’s television tower standing more than 360 meters tall and as such it is Berlin’s tallest structure which can be seen from virtually every part of Berlin. This idea for a tower was first raised in 1958 as part of the East Germany’s government efforts to have an iconic office tower in place. Two German architects proposed this tower’s construction and deemed it the “Tower of Signals.”
					</p>
					<p>It was on in late 1960s however that the idea for the Fersehtum was re-launched after being designed by a group of architects living in East Germany and with some help from Swedish engineers the TV tower was built. It finally opened in 1969 and became the DDR’s pride. Films covering the topic of communist propaganda were shown at the Fersehturm to promote East Berlin’s quality of life.
					</p>
					<p>Today, tourists can take an elevator from the base to the top of the tower. The large sphere located at the top has a viewing platform that gives you a 360 degree view of Berlin. On a clear day, you may be able to see as far as 25 miles away from the platform. At 207 meters high, directly above the platform is a revolving restaurant called Telecafe.
					</p>
					<p>Fersehtum sees close to 1.2 million visitors every year. Tickets need to be obtained to get into the Fersehtum and visitors are encouraged to reserve their tickets online. Visitors willing to pay for a VIP ticket can reserve a date and a time for their arrival.

					</p>
					<p>Brandenburg electors originally used Tiergarten as a place to hunt and it was not open to the public until the Prussian King Friederich decided that this place should not be used by selected few only.
					</p>
					<p>World War II did a severe damage to the park and afterwards even greater damage was done as Berlin residents practically cut down the remaining trees in the park to use them for firewood during the cold winters after the war. By 1995, the local government in Berlin decided to begin restoring it and by adding new plants, trees and shrubs they brought the park back to life.
					</p>

					<h1>Gendarmenmarkt</h1>
					<p>Gendarmenmarkt is one of Europe’s most beautiful squares surrounded by three beautiful landmarks - the Konzerthaus, the Franzosischer Dom and the Deutscher Dom. Located in this square’s center is a sculpture of the German poet Freidrich Schiller. Towards the second half of the 17th century the Gendarmenmarkt square was built as a home to the Linden Markt. Today it is mostly known for its quiet and architectural beauty.
					</p>
					<p>the Konzerthaus was built in 1821 by the famous Berlin architect named Karl-Freidrich Schinkel on top of the ruins that were the National Theatre, which was burned down in 1817. Some of the building’s columns and outside walls were re-used as part of the new building planning. The building was badly damaged during World War II and did not get reconstructed until 1984. It was then turned into the concert hall for the Berlin Symphony Orchestra.
					</p>
					<p>The Deutscher and Franzosischer are beautiful middle-ages churches with some obvious similarities to each other.
					</p>
					<p>The square is a great place to get some rest while strolling between one sight of Berlin to the other. Simply lay back and enjoy the beautiful architecture.

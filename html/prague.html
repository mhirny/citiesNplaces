					<h1>Charles Bridge</h1>
					<p>Once the most important bridge for commerce, the Charles Bridge in Prague is still very important, but now it is primarily significant for tourism. This beautiful cobblestone bridge is lined with intricate statues and lamp posts on either side. It crosses the river Vltava to the Prague Castle, and was named for King Charles IV who commissioned its building.  The view from this bridge of both the city skyline and the river below it are stunning.  Visitors are welcome and encouraged to walk across the bridge as it is now a pedestrian road.  Musicians, street performers, artists and other vendors line the street during the busiest times of the day. The quietest times are early morning and late evening. This is a don’t miss spot in Prague.

					<h1>Prague Castle</h1>
					<p>On a hilltop west of the Vltava River, resided what is perceived by many as Prague’s number one tourist attraction – the Prague Castle. What is called “The Prague Castle” is actually a huge complex of buildings connected by internal courtyards and built throughout the last 1000 years. It therefore provides a great opportunity to visit, in a relatively small location many architectural styles of the last millennium. An exploration of the castle can take anything between half a day and a full day, depending on how well you want to explore it. The main sights within the Castle are St. Vitus Cathedral, St. George's Basilica, the Royal Palace, the Powder Tower, and of course the Golden Lane in which Frantz Kafka used to live for a while.
					</p>
					<p>If you are interested in doing a little climb up the road, you can certainly walk up directly to the castle from Charles Bridge. Alternatively, it is also possible to use metro line A to Malostranská followed by tram no. 22 north (two stops) to "Prazský hrad".

					<h1>Old Town Square</h1>
					<p>At the heart of Prague’s Old Town, this majestic and extremely popular by tourists square with its colorful baroque houses is located just between the famous Wenceslas Square and Charles Bridge. The square presents several architectural styles such as gothic of the Týn Church or baroque architecture of the St. Nicholas Church. Many tourists come here to see the medieval Astronomical Clock built on top of the Town’s Hall that provides a musical show every hour from 8:00 Am to 8:00 PM. The Astronomical Clock, which now proudly symbolizes Prague, was originally build in 1410 which makes it the oldest working astronomical clock in the world. The various signs on the clock stand for the phases of the moon, the seasons and also for some of the Christian holidays.
					</p>
					<p>You may want to climb up to the Old Town Hall's tower to get a magnificent view of Staromestské námestí but keep in mind that the climb may be challenging as the steps are quite narrow and steep. If you’re not fit for that, taking the elevator may be a good alternative.
					</p>
					<p>As a day visit is a must, you may want to return at night time if only to have a look at the baroque buildings as they are lighted by the towers of the Týn church.

					<h1>Týn Church</h1>
					<p>Tyn church, also called the Church of Our Lady Before Tyn, is located in Prague’s Old Town Square while the towers or spires of the church can be seen from most everywhere in Prague. The church was renovated between the years 1975 through 1993 and is now structurally sound and in good condition. 
					</p>
					<p>The Tyn Church was built in 1385 by the Hussites, which were actively being slaughtered by Roman Catholics. The Catholic Jesuits later took over the Tyn Church and replaced the old bell with a large statue of Mary placed between the two large towers. Those two towers are not symmetrical and represent the male and female parts of the world, with the larger side representing the masculine side. The Gothic influence of building cannot be missed and some say that this church is the model for Walt Disney’s Sleeping Beauty castle.

					<h1>Old Jewish Cemetery</h1>
					<p>A very popular tourist attraction in Prague is one of Europe's oldest Jewish cemeteries. It is located the Josefov, the Jewish Quarter, one block away from the famous Old-New Synagogue and holds around 12,000 visible tombstones in a small yard which are only a small part out of the thousands of graves buried below. The reason is the rules published from the 15th century to 1787 by the rulers of Prague that did not allow for Jews to bury their dead anywhere else. The lack of space caused the graves to be piled one on top of the other. There are two significant graves here - the oldest, which belongs to one Avigdor Kara (a poet), who died according to the records in 1439 and the well-known grave of Jehuda ben Bezalel who is known for creating the “Golem of Prague”.

					<h1>St. Vitus Cathedral</h1>
					<p>While in Prague, one of the must-see sites is the beautiful St. Vitus Cathedral originally called St Vitus, St. Wenceslas and St. Adalbert Cathedral. The cathedral is located on the hilltop overlooking the city within the Prague Castle Complex. The complex itself is like a small town with a number of exquisite buildings, gardens and courtyards. The palace complex is the oldest in the world and was established in 880 and took 700 years to complete. The grand cathedral was where royals had their weddings, christenings and burials and until 1836 the Kings of Bohemia were coronated here. There is so much to see within the Palace complex that many walk right by the cathedral but it has a lot to offer.
					</p>
					<p>From the outside the austere Gothic architecture bears witness to the importance of this building as the country's largest and most important church. The church houses the tombs of Bohemian kings and rulers of the Holy Roman Empire. The cathedral covers an area of 124 meters X 60 meters and the tallest tower reaches 96.5 meters into the sky while the front tower is 82 meters high and the arch of the entrance is 33.2 meters high.
					</p>
					<p>Duke Wenceslas I first commissioned the construction of a Romanesque domed rotunda on the site of a former pagan temple. When the Bishopric of Prague was established in 1060 construction began on a two towered, triple-naved cathedral. In 1344 the Bishopric became an archbishopric and under Charles IV renovations began to turn the cathedral in to a grand coronation church and home for the religious relics of the kingdom. Construction proceeded slowly with intricate woodcarvings, sculptures, and gothic architectural elements being added. Attempts to finally complete the building during the 15th century left the cathedral with renaissance and baroque architectural elements as well as the Gothic. The final addition to the cathedral came in the 1920s when sculpture Vojtech Sucharda refined the façade; the Rose Window was added and painter Alfons Mucha completed the windows in the north part of the nave.
					</p>
					<p>Highlights of the St. Vitus Cathedral:
						<ul class = "displayBlock">
							<li>Bell Tower – The main spire or clock tower houses the largest church bell in Eastern Europe.  Climbing the 287 steps of the bell tower is possible in good weather when you can get magnificent views across the city.
							<li>St. Wenceslas Chapel – The chapel was built above the grave of St. Wenceslas and the walls are covered with frescoes and highlighted with 1,300 precious stones.
							<li>Triforium – A 14 meters high arcade encircles the church and contains 21 busts of Charles IV and other royals and clergy. The portraits here were created in the 14th century.
							<li>Windows – See the stain glass windows in the Chancel, the beautiful Cyril and Methodius window and the Rose Window above the church entrance.
							<li>Royal Crypt – Take the stairs down to the crypt with a vaulted ceiling. Here you'll see the tombs of Bohemian royals as well as what remains of the original 10th century rotunda built during Wenceslas I's reign.

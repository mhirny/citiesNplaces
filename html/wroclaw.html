					<h1>Ostrów Tumski</h1>
					<p>Ostrów Tumski is an island and the oldest part of Wrocław. Surrounded by the River Oder, this former garden, which gave rise to the city of Wrocław, is now featuring a number of impressive monuments. The most prominent monuments include the Cathedral of Saint John the Baptist (restored after World War II), the Holy Cross and Saint Bartholomew's Collegiate, which is a unique two-storey brick basilica. Located on the island is also the Archdiocese Museum, which for more than one hundred years has been collecting sacred art, including the celebrated Book of Henryków. Dated to the 13th–14th centuries, the book is known to feature the first sentence to have ever been recorded in Polish (the document was listed in the UNESCO Memory of the World Register). This is the only place is Wrocław where you can see a lamplighter turning on the gas lamps at dusk.

					<h1>Panorama of the Battle of Racławice</h1>
					<p>Painted by Jan Styka and Wojciech Kossak, the Racławice Panorama is a unique representation of the Battle of Racławice (4th April 1794), created to commemorate the centenary of the Kościuszko Uprising. The work, which boasts an impressive size of 15 x 114 m, is open to the public in a specially designed rotund building.

					<h1>The Centennial Hall</h1>
					<p>The Centennial Hall is one of the most prominent landmarks in the history of 20th-century architecture. Designed by the eminent architect Max Berg, it was created in 1913 to celebrate the international exhibition commemorating the Battle of the Nations. The dome of this early Modernist reinforced concrete structure is 1.5 times larger in diameter than the dome of Rome's Pantheon while weighing only 42% of its bulk. In 2006, the site was enlisted in the UNESCO World Heritage Register. You can find out more about its construction at the Cognitive Centre, a permanent multimedia exhibition. The Centennial Hall complex also features the Four Domes' Pavilion, designed by the eminent architect Hans Poelzig and developed from 1912–1913. The building, which formerly housed the Wrocław Feature Film Studio, has now been restored to serve exhibition purposes. The renovated building features one of Poland's most intriguing and developed collections of Polish contemporary art (the property of the National Museum in Wrocław). The Centennial Hall is surrounded by the Pergola, which boasts one of the largest multimedia fountains in Europe.
